# Branch Name Formatter

*Leer esto en [Español](README-es.md).*

A fast, local-first web tool designed for developers to generate consistent Git branch names instantly.

All processing is done locally in your web browser, ensuring **complete control** of your data (Local-First). Built with **Vue 3 (Composition API)** and **TypeScript**.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Branch Formats:** Comes with three ready-to-use formats (default app format, GitFlow, Conventional Commits) and lets you create, clone, edit, or delete your own from the Settings screen, with a live preview as you type.
- **Guaranteed Valid Names:** Sanitization (removing accents, spaces, dots, special characters, collapsing dashes...) is always applied, so every generated name is a valid git branch name. You only choose the capitalization per field (uppercase, lowercase, or as-is).
- **Language-Aware Sanitization:** Each format has a language profile (matching the app's 6 supported languages) that controls how `/` and language-specific characters (`ñ`, `ß`...) are translated into the branch name.
- **History Management:** Keeps track of your last 10 generated names for quick access (stored locally).
- **Local Processing:** Everything happens client-side. No server-side storage or processing of your branch data.
- **Interface:** Clean, professional, and responsive design with native dark/light mode support.
- **Multi-language:** Full UI support for English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, and Portuguese — including the format editor and the built-in formats themselves.

## Built With
- **Vue.js 3** (Composition API) + **Vite**
- **TypeScript** for robust, typed code.
- **Vue-i18n** for multi-language support.
- **Vanilla CSS / SCSS** for optimal performance and a professional "native" look.
