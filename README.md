# branch-name-formatter

Branch-name-formatter is a website developed with Vue.js and TypeScript that allows users to create and manage branch names with the appropriate format. It features a form to create the branch name and a list to view and delete the created names.

This project uses Vue components for the user interface and a BranchManager to handle the business logic. Additionally, it follows best development practices (SOLID, DRY, KISS, etc.) and includes unit tests for the components and the BranchManager.
