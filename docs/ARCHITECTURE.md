# Project Architecture

The **Branch Name Formatter** is built with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and privacy.

## Core Structure

### 1. Logic Layer (`src/core`)
- **`Branch.ts`** / **`BranchTypes.ts`**: The entity representing a generated branch name and its shared types.
- **`BranchManager.ts`**: A singleton class that manages the list of generated branches, handles storage in `localStorage` (via `LocalStorageManager`), and limits the history to 10 records.
- **`FormatTypes.ts`**: Types for the dynamic format system — `BranchFormatTemplate` (a format: id, name, template string, fields, language, visibility), `FieldDefinition` (a field: id, label, type, capitalization), `Capitalization` (`UPPERCASE` / `LOWERCASE` / `AS_IS`), and `LanguageProfile` (the 6 supported languages, used for sanitization rules — independent from the UI language).
- **`FormatManager.ts`**: A static class that owns the three built-in formats and all persistence for formats in `localStorage` — custom formats, hidden built-in formats, the app's default format id, and language overrides for built-in formats (the only field on a built-in format that can be changed in place).
- **`BranchFormatter.ts`**: Turns a `BranchFormatTemplate` + raw field values into the final branch name. Sanitization (accents, dots, spaces, special characters, multiple dashes, and the language-specific rules in `LANGUAGE_RULES` for `/` and characters like `ñ`/`ß`) is always applied and is not configurable; only the per-field capitalization is.

### 2. UI Layer (`src/components`)
- **`App.vue`**: Root layout — header, hero, and swaps between the main view and the configuration view.
- **`AppHeader.vue`**: Sticky header with the language selector and the settings toggle.
- **`AppMainView.vue`** / **`BranchForm.vue`**: The branch generator — renders the fields of the currently selected format dynamically and emits the generated name.
- **`BranchList.vue`** / **`BranchItem.vue`**: Display the branch history.
- **`AppConfigurationView.vue`**: The format management screen — lists all formats, lets you pick the app default, and hosts the editor.
- **`FormatEditor.vue`**: Edits a format. For custom formats, the full form (name, template, language, fields) is editable. For built-in formats, only the visibility switch and the language are editable; the rest is shown read-only (clone the format to fully customize it).
- **`FormatPreview.vue`**: Renders a live example of a format's output using its own field ids as placeholder values.
- **`CustomSelect.vue`** / **`CustomModal.vue`**: Shared, themeable replacements for native `<select>` and confirm dialogs, used throughout the app.
- **`LangSelector.vue`** / **`FlagIcon.vue`**: The UI language switcher.
- **`Footer.vue`**: Shows the app version (from `package.json`, injected at build time as `__APP_VERSION__`) linked to its GitHub release, plus license/source links.

### 3. Localization (`src/i18n`)
- One JSON file per supported language (`en`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `pt`), loaded by `vue-i18n` in `index.ts`.
- Most UI strings are looked up with `$t('namespace.key')`. Built-in format names and field labels are stored as i18n keys (e.g. `formats.gitflow.name`) inside `FormatManager`'s data rather than literal text, so they follow the selected UI language; custom formats store literal text instead. Components that display a format's `name`/field `label` check for a `.` to decide whether to translate it or show it as-is (see `BranchForm.vue`, `AppConfigurationView.vue`).

## Privacy & Data
No data ever leaves the user's browser. We do not use any external APIs or tracking services beyond an opt-in, cookie-consent-gated analytics script (see `CookieBanner.vue` / `utils/analytics.ts`). Everything else is stored in the browser's `localStorage`.
